(A) About the corpus
====================

The Oxford-NINJAL Corpus of Old Japanese (abbreviated ONCOJ) is
a lemmatized, parsed and comprehensively annotated digital
corpus of poetic texts in Japanese from the Old Japanese period.

Creation of the ONCOJ has been ongoing since 2011 (until 2017
under the name “The Oxford Corpus of Old Japanese (OCOJ)”).
Development continues as a long-term collaborative research project
between the University of Oxford and the National Institute for
Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL).

The ONCOJ is supported and recognized by the British
Academy as an Academy Research Project, and at NINJAL it
forms part of The Construction of Diachronic Corpora and New
Developments in Research on the History of Japanese project
(https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/english/research/project-3/institute/diachronic-corpora/).

More information about the corpus can be found on the project website:

(B) Corpus format
=================

The "lexicon.xml" file is the dictionary database for the corpus in an
XML format.

The "oncoj.csv" file contains all the corpus data given as comma-separated
values that can be seen with a spreadsheet program.

Files of the "psd" folder are formatted to be compatible with CorpusSearch,
see http://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/CS-manual/YourCorpus.html for
details. The corpus has been compiled into 26 ".psd" files according
to the sources of the texts.

Files of the "xml" folder are formatted to be TEI compatible. There are
4991 individual texts in the corpus, and each text is contained in a
single XML file.
